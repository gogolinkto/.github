## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ§‘ My name is Jorge and this is GoGoLink (named after the Go-Go-Gadget saying from Inspector Gadget). 

ðŸš€ GoGoLink is a URL Shortner. You know... kind of like bitly or tinyurl.

ðŸ¤” My goal was to build it with the right amount of features to be both minimalistic and powerful.

ðŸŽ‰ I decided to rebuild it on this organization but embracing the Open-Source, so I am building GoGoLink as a Open Source alternative to those services listed above, I host it and manage the repositories on GitHub but by building it openly everyone is allowed to contribute or change something in the platform that they want changed. This is a new experience for me but I think I will enjoy a lot having this exchange and to build it together with YOU.
